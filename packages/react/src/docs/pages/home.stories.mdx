# Design System Spike

A Design System encompasses design principles, UI components, patterns, style guidelines, and documentation. It's established to ensure brand consistency across various projects. Stemming from the challenges in design, its goal is to maintain visual uniformity, especially with multiple teams and designers involved. The system emphasizes including only universally applicable visual elements. Its main objective is to facilitate the consistent implementation of visual standards, thereby enhancing user experience.
